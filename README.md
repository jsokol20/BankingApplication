# BankingApplication
This is a banking application that I've created for my midterm datastructures project.

This software will keep a record of the users (which are the customers) that have an account at the bank. It will keep record of the two types of accounts the user will have it can either be a checking and or a savings account at the bank. It will let the user know how much they have left in their account, it will keep track of their deposits and how much they withdrew. In order to have it organized from person to person (senior, adult, student), the users will be organized with their address, name, the phone number, and their account id.
